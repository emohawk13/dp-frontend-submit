Submissions for DevPipeline's Frontend Course

To complete this assignment I wanted to create a simple portfolio site for Simpsons Troy McClure. 

Instructions provided for the assignment:

Wireframe your Website
Plan out the content for 1 (one) webpage.
There are a variety of ways to divide your content: story (beginning, middle, end), sales approach (hook, pitch, ask), mystery (clues from three separate witnesses and the outside source is the answer), debate (introduction, side 1 argument, side 2 argument) The possibilities are endless.
Map out your website on a whitboard or paper before you code using squares and rectangles to represent each element on the page.

An organized architecture in VS Code
Create a new project folder and name it after your website.
Set up the folder structure to include the file for each webpage.
Though not used yet, create a folder for pages, styles, images and scripts.
Provide a custom title that will appear in the page's tab at the top of the browser
Avoid using the emmet shortcuts.

Create a table that represents important information for your website's content.
Includes 5 (five) columns of information
Includes 10 (ten) rows of data for the five chosen points of information
Play close attention to how you wrap (open and close) the tags in relation to each part of the table
Use table data to make accessibility for screen readers and Search Engine Optimization. Consider downloading screen readers extensions and checking SEO of your html

Utilize each of the following tags throughout the website:
Document metadata
html "<html> </html>"

Sectioning root
body "<body> </body>"

Content sectioning
headings 1-6 "<h1> </h1>", "<h2> </h2>", etc.

Text content
division "<div> </div>"
paragraphs "<p> </p>"
list item "<li> </li>"
ordered list "<ol> </ol>"
unordered list "<ul> </ul>"

Table Content
table "<table> </table>"
table head "<thead> </thead>"
table header "<th> </th>"
table body "<tbody> </tbody>"
table row"<tr> </tr>"
table data "<td> </td>"
table foot"<tfoot> </tfoot>"
